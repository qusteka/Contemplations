A Student comes before his Master and asks him:

Why is it that i cannot let my Mind wander during Meditation, why must I focus?

The Master replies:

Pull up a chair and sit at this table.
Listen to the sounds I will create for you.

The Master proceeds to make many different noises some quiet, some loud but most of them bothersome and unsettling.
As time passes the Students face relaxes and his eyes become distant. He stops listening and drifts off into a world of his own.

Later still the Master approaches his Student and tells him:

You have mastered the Art of sitting in a chair, there is nothing I can teach you about it.
You have mastered the Art of becoming ignorant to your surroundings, there is nothing I can teach you about it.
You have mastered the Art of letting your mind Wander, there is nothing I can teach you about it.

Would you like to learn something new?

The Student finally understood.
